Hi!

In this article, I’ll tell you how to implement userspace file system
using Java without a line of kernel space code. I’ll also show you how
to connect Java and native code without writing C code and save maximum
performance.

Originally, I posted this article on
[habrahabr](https://habrahabr.ru/post/260801/) (in Russian).

## FUSE

First of all, it is important to understand what FUSE is. FUSE -
FileSystem in Userspace - helps users without any privileges to create
their file system without a necessity to write code in a kernel space.

This is possible because the filesystem code runs in userspace. And the
FUSE module is just a bridge between the kernel API and your code. FUSE
was officially included in the Linux source tree in 2.6.14.

So, you can easily create your own filesystem ([here is the simplest
example](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/master/example/hello.c)).
There are a lot of areas where you can use it. For example, you can
quickly write a FS where Github or DropBox would be the backend.

Or, let’s imagine, you have a business application where all user files
are stored in a database. But your client wants to have access to them
from a filesystem on the server. Of course to duplicate files in the
filesystem and the database is the wrong decision. And here FUSE comes
in; you just need a little FUSE program which handles all user requests
to the directory and redirects them to the database.

## Java and native code

So far so good. But implementation of FUSE starts from "include header
&lt;fuse.h&gt;". But your business application is written in Java.
Obviously, it is necessary to communicate with the native code.

### JNI

The standard tool for a native communication in Java is JNI. But it
brings a lot of complexity. Especially because for using FUSE we need a
lot of callbacks from the native code to Java. And "write once" is
suffering in this case (However, in the case of FUSE it is not so
important). If you try to find projects that implement a FUSE wrapper
using JNI you will find a few projects, but they have been obsolete for
a long time. And their API is very inconvenient.

### JNA

Another option is [JNA
library](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna). JNA (Java Native
Access) gives you the possibility to get access to the native code
easily without using JNI only by using Java code. It is very easy; you
just need to declare an interface which matches the native code and get
an implementation through "Native.loadLibrary". And that’s all. Another
advantage of JNA is very detailed documentation. The project is alive,
and it is in active development.

Moreover, a good project implementing FUSE using JNA already exists. But
JNA has a lot of problems with performance. JNA is reflection based, so
jumping from native code to Java code with data conversion is very
expensive. It is not so important if native calls are rare. But a FS has
a lot of native calls. The only way to speed up fuse-jna is to read
files using big chunks, but it doesn’t always work. For example, when
you have no access to a client’s code or when all files are small.
Obviously, we need a library that combines JNI performance and JNA
convenience.

### JNR

And here is where JNR (Java Native Runtime) comes in. JNR, like JNA, is
based on libffi library, but it uses a bytecode generation instead of
reflection. And as a result, JNR achieves excellent performance. The
information about JNR is very limited. The most detailed piece of
information is [Charles Nutter’s talk on JVMLS
2013](http://medianetwork.oracle.com/video/player/2630340184001). But
despite the lack of information, JNR is already a big ecosystem actively
used by JRuby. A lot of jnr-based libraries such as unix-sockets and
posix-api are actively used by different projects.

![](/images/jnr-fuse/jnr.png)

JNR is a library which became a basis for the development of [JEP 191 -
Foreign Function Interface](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/191), which is
targeted for Java 10. In comparison to JNA, JNR has no proper
documentation, and you need to look for answers in the source code. That
is the main reason for this mini-guide.

# Specialties of writing code using Java Native Runtime

## Function binding

*The simplest binding*
```java
import jnr.ffi.*;
import jnr.ffi.types.pid_t;

/**
 * Gets the process ID of the current process, and that of its parent.
 */
public class Getpid {
    public interface LibC  {
        public @pid_t long getpid();
        public @pid_t long getppid();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LibC libc = LibraryLoader.create(LibC.class).load("c");

        System.out.println("pid=" + libc.getpid() + " parent pid=" + libc.getppid());
    }
}
```

Here we are the loading java library which matches the native interface
by name.

In the case of FUSE, we need an interface with method fuse\_main\_real
where FuseOperations structure with all callbacks passes as an argument.

```java
public interface LibFuse {
    int fuse_main_real(int argc, String argv[], FuseOperations op, int op_size, Pointer user_data);
}
```

### Implementation of structures

Often you need to work with structure which is located at a certain
address, for example with fuse\_bufvec structure:
```c
struct fuse_bufvec {
    size_t count;
    size_t idx;
    size_t off;
    struct fuse_buf buf[1];
};
```

For its implementation, we need to make a successor of jnr.ffi.Struct.

```java
import jnr.ffi.*;

public class FuseBufvec extends Struct {
    public FuseBufvec(jnr.ffi.Runtime runtime) {
        super(runtime);
    }
    public final size_t count = new size_t();
    public final size_t idx = new size_t();
    public final size_t off = new size_t();
    public final FuseBuf buf = inner(new FuseBuf(getRuntime()));
}
```

After that, you have to set proper callback implementation into the
getattr field.

```java
fuseOperations.getattr.set((path, stbuf) -> 0);
```

### Enum

Enum implementation is not so obvious as other parts of the library. You
need to inherit your enum from jnr.ffi.util.EnumMapper.IntegerEnum and
implement method intValue

```java
enum fuse_buf_flags {
    FUSE_BUF_IS_FD    = (1 << 1),
    FUSE_BUF_FD_SEEK    = (1 << 2),
    FUSE_BUF_FD_RETRY    = (1 << 3),
};

public enum FuseBufFlags implements EnumMapper.IntegerEnum {
    FUSE_BUF_IS_FD(1 << 1),
    FUSE_BUF_FD_SEEK(1 << 2),
    FUSE_BUF_FD_RETRY(1 << 3);

    private final int value;

    FuseBufFlags(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    @Override
    public int intValue() {
        return value;
    }
}
```

### Work with memory

* For working with direct memory wrapper jnr.ffi.Pointer exists.
* You can allocate memory using jnr.ffi.Memory
* The entry point of JNR API learning is jnr.ffi.Runtime

This knowledge is enough to implement a simple cross-platform wrapper
for some native library.

## JNR-FUSE

What I’ve implemented is a FUSE wrapper in my project jnr-fuse.
Previously I used fuse-jna, but it was a bottleneck in the FS
implementation. During the development, I tried to save compatibility
with the native interface (&lt;fuse.h&gt;).

For implementing your own file system, you need to extend
ru.serce.jnrfuse.FuseStubFS and implement several methods.
Fuse\_operations contain [a lot of
methods](http://fuse.sourcearchive.com/documentation/2.8.4-1.4ubuntu1/structfuse__operations.html),
but for getting your FS up and running, you just need to implement
several methods. It is very easy, [here are some
examples](https://github.com/SerCeMan/jnr-fuse/tree/master/src/main/java/ru/serce/jnrfuse/examples).

Currently, only Linux is supported (x86 and x64).

Library exists in JCenter.

*Gradle*
```kotlin
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.serceman:jnr-fuse:0.1'
}
```

*Maven*
```xml

### JNR-FUSE and FUSE-JNA performance comparison

In my case the FS was read-only, and I was interested in throughput. The
performance will mostly depend on your FS implementation, so if you
already use fuse-jna, you’ll be able to change it easily to jnr-fuse,
write a test, and to see the performance difference on your workload.
(It will be helpful anyway because we all love to achieve new levels of
performance, right?)

In order to show performance the difference, I moved MemoryFS
implementation from fuse-jna to jnr-fuse with minimal changes and ran a
reading test. For the test, I used
[fio](http://freecode.com/projects/fio) framework.

The only information this test shows us is the difference in reading a
file using fuse-jna and jnr-fuse, but it gives us an understanding of
the level of performance difference of JNA and JNR. If you are
interested, you can write a more detailed test for native calls using
the [JMH](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/) tool.

The performance differences in throughput and latency are about ~10
times. Charles Nutter in his presentation gave us the same numbers.
