Hi!

As software engineers, we all rely on the notion of time: a crucial
concept in ensuring that events in our programs follow a chronological
order. Yet, invoking a simple call to “get the current time” can
potentially yield unexpected results and lead to unforeseen consequences
if not used correctly. Moreover, the invariants about time we observe on
our local development machine may not necessarily hold in the cloud, or
in any distributed system.

In this article, I’ll go through the different ways we can obtain the
current time in our programs, and present cases where our intuitions and
expectations of time from these clocks may mislead us at best or cause
catastrophic failures at worst.

## Your local clocks

Let me start by asking you six questions. Here is a set of code
snippets. Is it possible that the expression passed to `isThisPossible`
is true? Take a guess.

<div className="formalpara-title">

    <span id="aq1"></span>1. Is this possible?

<CheckResults/>

Was the result surprising? My sincere kudos if it was not. The next
section of the article will explain why certain behaviour can or can not
be observed.

But why do we even care? Very often we don’t need to, but the snippets
of code where the business logic relies on the observed timestamps are
typically critical pieces of infrastructure code where correctness is a
must. False assumptions in these parts of the code can lead to huge
incidents. This, for instance, happened to [Cloudflare in
2017](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-and-why-the-leap-second-affected-cloudflare-dns/),
where the root cause "was the belief that time cannot go backwards".
Cloudflare is one of the few companies that openly publishes incident
reports, but it’s not uncommon to suffer from such false assumptions, as
a few Google searches can confirm, and we can all learn from these
mistakes. To understand why certain clocks behave in a certain way, we
first need to understand what properties different clocks can give us.

### Monotonicity

The first property is monotonicity. A monotonically increasing function
means that for every subsequent invocation of such a function the
produced value is never smaller than any of the previous values. So, a
monotonic clock is a clock that never goes backwards. Sadly, and
surprisingly, this property is not a feature of many clocks.

### Resolution

Resolution is the second property. It is the smallest observable
difference between two clock ticks. The resolution of a simple
mechanical watch with a second hand is one second. When you’re staring
at the watch, the meaningful watch hand position can be at 12 seconds or
13 seconds, but never 12 and a half.

### Latency

Very often latency is overlooked when we’re talking about clocks, but
it’s quite important when we’re considering other properties like
resolution. For instance, it doesn’t matter if you have the most precise
atomic watch on your hand with picosecond resolution ‒ if I ask you what
time it is and it takes you roughly a second, sometimes less, sometimes
more, to take a look and respond, all of this precision fades away.

So, what properties do Java clocks have, and how do they apply to the
questions that we looked at the beginning?

## Clocks on the wall

Let’s start with `System.currentTimeMillis()`. Usually, the best place
to start the exploration is the documentation written in the Javadoc,
and there is a lot there to take in. Here is an excerpt of what is
important to us right now.

<div className="formalpara-title">

    _[Javadoc](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk11/file/1ddf9a99e4ad/src/java.base/share/classes/java/lang/System.java#l375)_

</div>

``` java
/**
 * Returns the current time in milliseconds. Note that
 * while the unit of time of the return value is a millisecond,
 * the granularity of the value depends on the underlying
 * operating system and may be larger.  For example, many
 * operating systems measure time in units of tens of
 * milliseconds.
 *
 * ...
 *
 * @return  the difference, measured in milliseconds, between
 *          the current time and midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC.
 */
public static native long currentTimeMillis();
```

As we can see, the clock provides us with a millisecond precision value
but the actual resolution depends on the operating system. Moreover, if
we measure the latency by measuring the execution time, it will be way
below 1 millisecond, so it’s maybe not a surprise that the answer to the
[first question](#aq1) was yes.

But can it go backwards? The Javadoc doesn’t mention anything about
monotonicity, so we need to dig deeper, and take a look at the
implementation.


| ⚠️ | This article only explores the native implementation for Linux and MacOS. However, similar techniques can be applied to other operating systems as well.|
|----|---|

The method is native, so the implementation depends on the underlying
OS. The native implementation for Linux and MacOS look almost identical.

<div className="formalpara-title">

    _[Linux](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk11/file/1ddf9a99e4ad/src/hotspot/os/linux/os_linux.cpp#l1204)_

</div>

``` cpp
jlong os::javaTimeMillis() {
  timeval time;
  int status = gettimeofday(&time, NULL);
  assert(status != -1, "linux error");
  return jlong(time.tv_sec) * 1000  +  jlong(time.tv_usec / 1000);
}
```

<div className="formalpara-title">

    _[MacOS](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk11/file/1ddf9a99e4ad/src/hotspot/os/bsd/os_bsd.cpp#l893)_

</div>

``` cpp
jlong os::javaTimeMillis() {
  timeval time;
  int status = gettimeofday(&time, NULL);
  assert(status != -1, "bsd error");
  return jlong(time.tv_sec) * 1000  +  jlong(time.tv_usec / 1000);
}
```

The functions invoke exactly the same syscall, `gettimeofday`. The man
page can provide us with more info, but more importantly with some
valuable notes:

<div className="formalpara-title">

    _[man page](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/gettimeofday.2.html)_

</div>

```
NAME
       gettimeofday, settimeofday - get / set time

NOTES
       The time returned by gettimeofday() is affected by discontinuous
       jumps in the system time (e.g., if the system administrator manually
       changes the system time).  If you need a monotonically increasing
       clock, see clock_gettime(2).
```

As noted above, the time is affected by discontinuous jumps in the
system time, which could be backwards, hence the clock is not monotonic.
The answer to the [third question](#aq3) was yes which does make sense:
if we change the current time to one hour ago, we still want
`currentTimeMillis` to return current time, even though the definition
of the current time has changed. That’s why it’s often called wall-clock
time, the clock on the wall can also jump back in time if we adjust it.

### The nanos of the current time

The same exploration path can be taken for `System.nanoTime()`. Let’s
start from the Javadoc which has even more intriguing details than the
previous one; here is an excerpt.

<div className="formalpara-title">

    _[Javadoc](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk11/file/1ddf9a99e4ad/src/java.base/share/classes/java/lang/System.java#l394)_

</div>

``` java
/**
 * Returns the current value of the running Java Virtual Machine's
 * high-resolution time source, in nanoseconds.
 *
 * This method can only be used to measure elapsed time and is
 * not related to any other notion of system or wall-clock time.
 * The value returned represents nanoseconds since some fixed but
 * arbitrary <i>origin</i> time (perhaps in the future, so values
 * may be negative) ...
 *
 * <p>This method provides nanosecond precision, but not necessarily
 * nanosecond resolution ...
 *
 * <p>The values returned by this method become meaningful only when
 * the difference between two such values, obtained within the same
 * instance of a Java virtual machine, is computed.
 *
 * ...
 */
public static native long nanoTime();
```

Apparently, the time returned by this clock isn’t related to any
real-world time; it can only be used to compare the timestamps within
the same JVM instance, and it’s relative to an arbitrary “origin” which
can be in the future, and therefore it might be negative – which answers
the [sixth question](#aq3). Similar to `currentTimeMillis`, this method
provides nanosecond precision, but not necessarily nanosecond
resolution.

Nano time can only be used to measure time intervals, so it ought to be
monotonic, right? Unfortunately, the Javadoc doesn’t say anything about
monotonicity, so the next step is the implementation.

<div className="formalpara-title">

    _[Linux](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk11/file/1ddf9a99e4ad/src/hotspot/os/linux/os_linux.cpp#l1301)_

</div>

``` cpp
jlong os::javaTimeNanos() {
  if (os::supports_monotonic_clock()) {
    struct timespec tp;
    int status = Linux::clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &tp);
    assert(status == 0, "gettime error");
    jlong result = jlong(tp.tv_sec) * (1000 * 1000 * 1000) + jlong(tp.tv_nsec);
    return result;
  } else {
    timeval time;
    int status = gettimeofday(&time, NULL);
    assert(status != -1, "linux error");
    jlong usecs = jlong(time.tv_sec) * (1000 * 1000) + jlong(time.tv_usec);
    return 1000 * usecs;
  }
}
```

Here comes the first surprise: nano time is indeed monotonic but
_only_ if the underlying operating system supports it. To be fair, any
modern Linux server supports `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`; there are, however, some
[rare situations](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51345008/1542319) in which
it might not hold true.

<div className="formalpara-title">

    _[MacOS](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk11/file/1ddf9a99e4ad/src/hotspot/os/bsd/os_bsd.cpp#l893)_

</div>

``` cpp
jlong os::javaTimeNanos() {
  const uint64_t tm = mach_absolute_time();
  const uint64_t now = (tm * Bsd::_timebase_info.numer) / Bsd::_timebase_info.denom;
  const uint64_t prev = Bsd::_max_abstime;
  if (now <= prev) {
    return prev;   // same or retrograde time;
  }
  const uint64_t obsv = Atomic::cmpxchg(now, &Bsd::_max_abstime, prev);
  assert(obsv >= prev, "invariant");   // Monotonicity
  // If the CAS succeeded then we're done and return "now".
  // If the CAS failed and the observed value "obsv" is >= now then
  // we should return "obsv".  If the CAS failed and now > obsv > prv then
  // some other thread raced this thread and installed a new value, in which case
  // we could either (a) retry the entire operation, (b) retry trying to install now
  // or (c) just return obsv.  We use (c).   No loop is required although in some cases
  // we might discard a higher "now" value in deference to a slightly lower but freshly
  // installed obsv value.   That's entirely benign -- it admits no new orderings compared
  // to (a) or (b) -- and greatly reduces coherence traffic.
  // We might also condition (c) on the magnitude of the delta between obsv and now.
  // Avoiding excessive CAS operations to hot RW locations is critical.
  // See https://blogs.oracle.com/dave/entry/cas_and_cache_trivia_invalidate
  return (prev == obsv) ? now : obsv;
}
```

The first thing that stands out is the giant wall of comments. As
software engineers, we know that if there is a long comment then
something dodgy must be going on. Indeed, the comment is quite
interesting. The call to
[`mach_absolute_time`](https://opensource.apple.com/source/Libc/Libc-320.1.3/i386/mach/mach_absolute_time.c.auto.html)
uses the [RDTSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Stamp_Counter)
instruction underneath which can _potentially_ lead to non-monotonic
behaviour on machines with multiple CPU sockets, which recently span up
another thought-provoking discussion on the [mechanical
sympathy](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mechanical-sympathy/7WnH37dA6Yc)
mailing list.

So, at least, we can be confident that nano time is always monotonic on
MacOS, right? Actually, it depends on the JVM version. The code listed
above was introduced in JDK9 in
[JDK-8040140](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8040140) and
backported to JDK8. Before, all you could hope for was non-monotonic
time which provided at best microsecond resolution because
`gettimeofday` was used. If we run some
[benchmarks](https://shipilev.net/blog/2014/nanotrusting-nanotime/#_latency),
we’ll see that the latency for these calls can be as small as 30ns, so
suddenly the answer to the [second](#aq2) and the [fourth](#aq4)
questions is true, or rather "it depends".

### When milliseconds are not enough

The microsecond precision in the case of `gettimeofday` is much more
than `System.currentTimeMillis()` can give us, but in the process of
conversion precision is lost.

``` cpp
jlong os::javaTimeMillis() {
  timeval time;
  int status = gettimeofday(&time, NULL);
  assert(status != -1, "linux error");
  return jlong(time.tv_sec) * 1000  +  jlong(time.tv_usec / 1000);
                                                      // ^^ precision loss
}
```

The OS can give us additional information which we violently discard in
order to fit it into a single long. What if we really want to know these
micros? In JDK 8, the new JSR 310 arrived which made it possible to
obtain an instance of `Instant` class which contains the number of
seconds since the epoch and the number of nanoseconds since the last
second started.

<div className="formalpara-title">

    _[JSR 310: Date and Time API](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310)_

</div>

``` java
Instant instant = Clock.systemUTC().instant();
long epochSecond = instant.getEpochSecond();
int nanoSinceSecond = instant.getNano();
```

Finally, all Java developers got access to wall-clock time with high
precision, right? Not so fast, if we take a look at the implementation
in JDK8, we’ll find out that it simply delegates straight to
`System.currentTimeMillis()`.

<div className="formalpara-title">

    _[JDK8
    Clock](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/687fd7c7986d/src/share/classes/java/time/Clock.java#l469)_

</div>

``` java
@Override
public long millis() {
    return System.currentTimeMillis();
}
@Override
public Instant instant() {
    return Instant.ofEpochMilli(millis());
}
```

Evidently, this is not optimal and there is a corresponding issue
[JDK-8068730](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8068730) which
has already been resolved and as a result, the precision was increased.
It requires an update to JDK9+ where the method delegates to a native
call with the following implementation on Linux. Assuming that your OS
can provide microsecond resolution, this clock is a great example of a
clock with nanosecond precision, but only microsecond resolution.

<div className="formalpara-title">

    _[JDK9+
    Clock](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk11/file/1ddf9a99e4ad/src/hotspot/os/linux/os_linux.cpp#l1211)_

</div>

``` java
void os::javaTimeSystemUTC(jlong &seconds, jlong &nanos) {
  timeval time;
  int status = gettimeofday(&time, NULL);
  assert(status != -1, "linux error");
  seconds = jlong(time.tv_sec);
  nanos = jlong(time.tv_usec) * 1000;
}
```

## Time exchange

The possibility to get the current wall-clock time with microsecond
resolution is great, but is needed often? One of the reasons to use
wall-clock time is to be able to relate an event that happened on one
machine to another event that happened on a different machine, or more
precisely, to decide on the order of these events. The events can be
very different in nature. Some of them might not be very critical, like
the timestamp on a log line, but some of them must be correct, like when
there is a conflict in a database due to two values being written
concurrently and timestamps are used to determine which event was last.
This strategy is called Last Write Wins, or simply LWW.

<CanvaEmbed designID="DADZmyL_mRw"/>

On the slides above, two clients Alice and Bob are trying to write
simultaneously into an eventually consistent webscale database with two
nodes. While the first value written by Alice was successfully
synchronized, Alice’s second write happened to be at approximately the
same time as Bob’s. In this situation, the database must resolve the
conflict so that the data is consistent between all of the nodes. In the
case of LWW, the latest write will be chosen by comparing the timestamps
of each write. LWW works perfectly if the clocks are perfectly
synchronised, however, if the clocks are poorly synchronised and the
clock of the first node has drifted ahead of the second node, LWW
becomes Lucky Write Wins – the client connected to the lucky node always
wins the conflict.

### NTP

The standard approach to make sure that the clocks on different nodes in
the cluster are synchronized is to use Network Time Protocol (NTP). Not
only does NTP help synchronise clocks, it also helps propagate a leap
second flag. Leap second is an occasional event where an additional
second is introduced in between 23:59:59 of a chosen day and 00:00:00 of
the following day. It’s often implemented as playing the same second
twice which from the observer’s point of view might look like a jump 1
second back in time. The last leap second was introduced on the 31st of
December 2016 which resulted in the above-mentioned DNS incident.

![](/images/time/time_2.png)

The conventional way of dealing with leap seconds is "leap smearing".
The NTP server which is responsible for leap smearing can distribute the
additional second amongst 12 hours before and 12 hours after the second
is introduced. The wall-clock time during these 24 hours is ticking
slower and every second is 1/86400 longer which might be surprising,
however less surprising than a jump back in time. The catch is that not
many NTP servers support leap smearing, the public NTP servers most
definitely don’t.

The major cloud providers,
[Google](https://developers.google.com/time/smear) and
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/look-before-you-leap-the-coming-leap-second-and-aws/)
both provide NTP services with leap smearing support. If your
application is hosted on a platform that provides an NTP service and you
care about clock synchronisation it’s worthwhile checking that NTP
synchronisation is set up with the provider’s NTP service. Not only can
it help avoid the nasty consequences of applying leap seconds naïvely,
but it also dramatically decreases the synchronisation error since the
network latency is typically much lower within a single datacenter.

Using a local NTP server can reduce the clock drift down to milliseconds
or even microseconds in the best case, but what is the worst case? There
is not much research on this topic, however some notable results were
mentioned in the Google Spanner paper.

## Logical conclusion

Even if the monitoring in our cluster shows that the clocks are
synchronised with microsecond precision, we need to be cautious and
shouldn’t rely on this in our software if a failure of this assumption
is unacceptable. So, if a failure is unacceptable and we need to know
the order of the events in a distributed system, is there anything we
can do? As always, there is a number of solutions suggested by academia.

### Lamport clocks

What we need is a reliable replacement for our system clocks, so that
for every two events *A* and *B* we can say that either *A* happened
before *B*, or *B* happened before *A*. Such order between events is
called total order. In the ["Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in
a Distributed
System"](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/time-clocks.pdf) paper
Leslie Lamport described the "happens before" relation and logical
clocks that can be used to define total order for a set of events using
the following algorithm.

<div class="tablediv">
<table>
    <colgroup>
        <col style={{width: "50%"}}/>
        <col style={{width: "50%"}}/>
    </colgroup>
    <tbody>
    <tr className="odd">
        <td style={{textAlign: "left"}}><p>Sending a message</p></td>
        <td style={{textAlign: "left"}}><p>Receiving a message</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr className="even">
        <td style={{textAlign: "left"}}><pre className="pseudocode">
```
time = time + 1;
send(message, time);
```
        </pre>
        </td>
        <td style={{textAlign: "left"}}><pre className="pseudocode">
```
(message, ts) = receive();
time = max(ts, time) + 1;
```
</pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
</div>

Every actor, in this case, Alice and Bob, will maintain a shared view of
the current time by maintaining a `time` counter which increases every
time a message is sent, and when a message is received, the `time` is
always bigger than the last observed counter. That way if Alice updates
the Database as shown below with the value 2 and tells Bob about the
last known state, Bob’s final write carries with it the knowledge of
seeing Alice’s counter, so it’s chosen as the final state of the
database.

| ❗️ | In the slides below, Alice tells Bob the value she wrote to the first node. Alternatively, Bob could have read the same value from the first node, leading to the same result – Alice and Bob don't have to communicate directly. |
|----|---|

<CanvaEmbed designID="DADZnGWHlAU"/>

This works perfectly as long as we need to define some total order of
the events in the system which captures the causality. It’s important to
note that having total order means that concurrent events will be
ordered in some way, not necessarily the most logical way. On the slides
below, Alice never talked to Bob, but her counter is bigger which leads
to her write being chosen in the case of a conflict.

<CanvaEmbed designID="DADZnC8PNnM"/>


### Vector clocks

To deal with truly concurrent events, we need a new definition or order
which is able to express the situation in which events can happen
concurrently. Such order is called partial order. Basically, this means
that for any two events *A* and *B*, it’s possible to say whether *A*
happened before *B*, *B* happened before *A* or *A* and *B* happened
concurrently. To determine partial order the following algorithm can be
used this, where every actor has a separate time counter, and keeps
track of the latest timestamp of any other actor in the system.

The algorithm was described in 1988, and later using vector clocks for
conflict resolution in a database was described in the Dynamo paper. On
the following slides, Alice keeps track of her own time counter as well
as Bob’s last known time counter. That way when Alice sends a message to
Bob, he updates his counters and the next message sent to the database
is chosen during the conflict resolution because each component of Bob’s
time vector is larger than the respective component of the previous
vector.

When there is a real conflict, vector clocks can help to determine
whether the events were truly concurrent. In the scenario below, two
nodes end up with the events, `[0, 1]` and `[0, 1]` which cannot be
ordered. In this situation, the database can keep both values, and
return them the next time it is read, to let either Alice or Bob decide
which one to keep so that the data is not lost.

These properties, however, do not come for free. The metadata needs to
be exchanged with every message, and multiple versions need to be
stored. After all, some databases, like Cassandra don’t use vector
clocks [for a reason](https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/why-cassandra-doesnt-need-vector-clocks).

## Conclusion

- Use `System.nanoTime()` for measuring time intervals

- Use `System.currentTimeMillis()` for obtaining wall-clock time

- Use `Clock.systemUTC().instant()` for getting wall-clock time with ns
*precision*

- Not every clock can give you the resolution you want even if its
precision is high

- The wall-clock time can be off by dozens of milliseconds (or more, or
less)

- Use NTP from your cloud provider if time synchronisation matters

- Logical clocks might be more appropriate than the real clocks but they
have associated costs
