Hi!

Kotlin is a very rich language. Unlike many other languages, it allows
developers to create another language inside it. For example, to mimic
HTML syntax or to build a completely typed SQL query. But Kotlin’s power
isn’t limited to simple DSLs. With some Kotlin-fu, it’s possible to
write a DSL that allows manipulating untyped data structures in a typed
manner. In this article, we’ll go through different ways to define DSL
in Kotlin, from very simple to fantastically powerful.

<div class="warning">

    Some parts of this article might be hard to understand without knowledge
    of Kotlin syntax. I tried to explain every feature I showed, but the
    general ability to speak Kotlin is strongly suggested.

</div>

So, let’s begin the journey.

## What is s DSL

> limited expressiveness focused on a particular domain

Here though, I prefer to give DSLs a slightly different definition which
reflects what is written in the article

> a language (or a set of abstractions) that’s built to deal with a
> specific domain

The main difference is that a DSL might not only be a separate language
but also a subset of a language which is used to work on a specific
domain. This kind of DSL can even be built in Java with some fluent API,
but very often it’s indistinguishable from a plain good code. To
contrast in Kotlin, many remarkable features might make an internal DSL
look different.

## Calling convention

The first feature actively used by DSLs in Kotlin is a special calling
convention. If the last parameter of a method is a function, and you’re
passing a lambda expression there, you can specify it outside of
parentheses.

For example, if one wants to create a function `dotimes` that takes a
number `n`, a function `f` and applies it, the easiest way to do that is

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **good old dotimes**

</div>

``` kotlin
fun dotimes(n: Int, f: () -> Unit) {
    for (i in 0..n-1) {
        f()
    }
}
```

The `dotimes` can be called in this way

``` kotlin
dotimes(5, {
    println("Hello, Kotlin!")
})
```

Or, using the lambda parameter convention and placing lambda function
outside parentheses.

``` kotlin
dotimes(5) {
    println("Hello, Kotlin!")
}
```

Moreover, the parentheses can be omitted completely if a lambda is the
only parameter of a function. E.g. `do5times` function that only takes a
lambda as a parameter can be defined and called as

``` kotlin
fun do5times(f: () -> Unit) = dotimes(5, f)

do5times {
    println("Hello, Kotlin!")
}
```

But despite being important, that calling convention is just a tiny
contribution to DSLs when compared to extension functions.

## Extension functions

Extension functions simply allow you to extend the functionality of a
class from the outside.

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **Simple extension function**

</div>

``` kotlin
fun String.removeSpaces(): String {
    return this.filter({ c -> c != ' ' })
}

print("Hi ! , ext".removeSpaces()) // "Hi!,ext"
```

Here, the `removeSpace` function is defined on the class String which
enables an ability to call `removeSpaces` on any `String` instance.
Unsurprisingly, it removes all the spaces from it. Inside the functions,
`this` refers to the instance of a receiver class and can be omitted
like you do when you’re writing a member function. That might sound
complicated if you have never heard about extension functions before,
but looking at the result of the compilation might make it much easier
to understand.

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **Decompiled java code**

</div>

``` java
public static String removeSpaces(String $receiver) {
  StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
  for (int i = 0; i < $receiver.length(); i++) {
    char c = $receiver.charAt(i);
    if (c != ' ') {
      sb.append(c);
    }
  }
  return sb.toString();
}
```

Extension functions are not some kind of magic. It’s not a Groovy-like
monkey patching, they get compiled to simple static functions. But that
example shows us a very important caveat - extension functions are
resolved statically because there is no dispatch mechanism for static
methods

Even though this snippet is very simple, it can raise another question -
"where did the `StringBuilder` came from?". An close look at the first
snippet through `Java` glasses gives the answer - there is no function
called `filter` defined in the class String. `filter` is also an
extension function defined in the Kotlin standard library.

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **filter function from kotlin stdlib**

</div>

``` kotlin
public inline fun String.filter(predicate: (Char) -> Boolean): String {
  val destination = StringBuilder()
  for (index in 0..length - 1) {
    val element = get(index)
    if (predicate(element))
      destination.append(element)
  }
  return destination.toString()
}
```

Kotlin defines a lot of extension functions for Java classes in the
standard library. That’s why Kotlin is so convenient to use. One might
notice that the function has an `inline` modifier on it which explains
why decompiled `removeSpaces` has a `StringBuilder` inside and not a
call to `filter`.

Many newcomers to Kotlin use the `inline` modifier everywhere under the
impression that inlining can improve performance. It can, but in many
cases, inline functions don’t improve performance at all, they even can
make it worse. There is an inspection for that in IntelliJ IDEA.

![](/images/fantastic/inspection.png)

There are also some other uses for `inline` which can be found in
[docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/inline-functions.html).

### Extension function on generic type

The Kotlin compiler is smart enough to allow for the definition of
extension functions on a certain generic type. In this example,
`toIntArray` function can be called only on a collection that contains
integers. This makes extension functions truly unique, there is no way
(without subclassing) to define a method for `Collection` class that can
be called only on an `Int` collection.

``` kotlin
fun Collection<Int>.toIntArray(): IntArray {
  val result = IntArray(size)
  var index = 0
  for (element in this)
    result[index++] = element
  return result
}
```

``` kotlin
listOf(1, 2, 3).toIntArray()       // works
listOf("1", "2", "3").toIntArray() // type error
```

If Kotlin has become your native language, you might be wondering now,
why I’m talking about these simple features in an article about DSLs.
The thing is, the majority of Kotlin DSLs are based on the
expressiveness of the two features mentioned above.

### First simple DSL

Given the aforementioned features, it’s very easy to write a first very
simple DSL.

Let’s say we need to write an event-based droid fighting platform so
that users can provide their own strategies and register them on the
platform. For each event the user is interested in, they must provide a
callback with the droid’s behaviour. A droid has an interface with a few
methods for defeating other droids. Or, humans if you will.

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **the droid**

</div>

``` kotlin
interface Droid {
  val peopleAround: Boolean
  val gun: Gun

  fun fire(gun: Gun)
  fun moveLeft()
  fun moveRight()
}
```

This sounds like an ideal case for DSL and now we need to define a
public API which the clients will be happy to use. To provide the
droid’s behaviour we’ll write a public function.

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **API**

</div>

``` kotlin
private val droid: Droid = getDroid() // inaccessible from the public API

public fun on(cmd: String, f: Droid.() -> Unit) {
// ...
  droid.f()
// ...
}
```

The type of the argument `f` might look weird, but it’s just the type of
0-arity extension function on the type Droid. And finally, the APIs
consumers can register events in the platform.

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **strategy example**

</div>

``` kotlin
on("back") {
  moveLeft()
  if (peopleAround) {
    fire(gun)
  }
}
```

Here, the anonymous extension function is a second parameter and
therefore can be written outside parentheses. `this` in the function has
a type `Droid` and therefore `moveLeft()` as well as other functions and
properties can be called by themselves without providing an explicit
receiver type..

The strategy looks very natural, it clearly says that if our droid
receives a `back` command, it should move left and try to shoot some
folks around him. The next snippet shows to what it can be compiled to
in order to make it even clearer for those who don’t speak kotlin well
yet.

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **decompiled java call**

</div>

``` java
on("back", new Function1<Droid, Unit>() {
  public Unit invoke(Droid droid) {
    droid.moveLeft();
    if (droid.getPeopleAround()) {
      droid.fire(droid.getGun());
    }
    return Unit.INSTANCE;
  }
});
```

## HTML builders

Building DSLs using extension functions isn’t limited to simple droid
fighting strategies. For example, it allows us to build a completely
typed HTML syntax; HTML builders are even mentioned in the [official
documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/type-safe-builders.html).

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **html builders**

</div>

``` kotlin
val list = listOf("Kotlin", "is", "awesome")
val result: HTML =
  html {
    head {
      title { +"HTML DSL in Kotlin" }
    }
    body {
      p {
        +"a line about Kotlin"
      }
      a(href = "jetbrains.com/kotlin") {
        +"Kotlin"
      }
      p {
        +"Kotlin is:"
        ul {
          for (arg in list)
            li { +arg }
        }
      }
    }
  }
println(result)
```

And these type-safe builders aren’t a Kotlin invention, on the JVM land
they were originated in Groovy. But Groovy is a dynamic language,
builders there are not type-safe.

<div class="important">

    It wouldn’t be completely fair to say that even though it’s what
    Kotlin’s documentation says, Groovy supports static compilation
    optionally and there are some ways to compile builders statically as
    well.

[//]: # (&#40;<http://melix.github.io/blog/2013/02/13/static_builders_inception.html>&#41;)

</div>

The implementation of a DSL in dynamically typed languages is often very
different to statically typed languages. In Kotlin, in order to build a
DSL, you need to describe the whole schema of the future language. And
given that the result is a deeply nested data structure, the easiest way
to convert it to string is to traverse the whole data-structure
recursively.

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **base interface**

</div>

``` kotlin
interface Element {
  fun render(builder: StringBuilder, indent: String)
}
```

The simplest line of text can be represented as

``` kotlin
class TextElement(val text: String) : Element {
  override fun render(builder: StringBuilder, indent: String) {
    builder.append("$indent$text\n")
  }
}
```

The real tag representation is a bit more complex

``` kotlin
abstract class Tag(val name: String) : Element {
  val children = arrayListOf<Element>()
  val attributes = hashMapOf<String, String>()

  // open tag
  // render attributes
  // render children recursively
  // close tag
  override fun render(builder: StringBuilder, indent: String) {
    builder.append("$indent<$name${renderAttributes()}>\n")
    for (c in children) {
      c.render(builder, indent + "  ")
    }
    builder.append("$indent</$name>\n")
  }

  private fun renderAttributes() = attributes.map { (k, v) -> " $k=\"$v\"" }.joinToString("")

  protected fun <T : Element> initTag(tag: T, init: T.() -> Unit) {
    tag.init()
    children.add(tag)
  }

  operator fun String.unaryPlus() {
    children.add(TextElement(this))
  }

  override fun toString(): String {
    val builder = StringBuilder()
    render(builder, "")
    return builder.toString()
  }
}
```

It contains a representation of attributes and a set of children. But
the main part that requires attention is the `initTag` function which
looks very similar to the function `on` from the "robot fighting" DSL
definition.

Another interesting part is an extension function `unaryPlus` defined as
an operator for class String inside the `Tag`. It allows us to use a
convenient (but let’s be honest not obvious at all) way to insert a line
of text inside code like:

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ unary plus to append a line of text**

</div>

``` kotlin
body {
  +"just a random line"
  +"another line"
}
```

And the rest of the DSL is an enumeration of all possible tags.

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **\<head\>,\<title\>,\<body\>,\<a\>,\<ul\>,\<li\>,\<p\>**

</div>

``` kotlin
class HTML : Tag("html") {
  fun head(init: Head.() -> Unit) = initTag(Head(), init)

  fun body(init: Body.() -> Unit) = initTag(Body(), init)
}

class Head : Tag("head") {
  fun title(init: Title.() -> Unit) = initTag(Title(), init)
}

class Title : Tag("title")

abstract class BodyTag(name: String) : Tag(name) {
  fun p(init: P.() -> Unit) = initTag(P(), init)
  fun ul(init: UL.() -> Unit) = initTag(UL(), init)
  fun a(href: String, init: A.() -> Unit) {
    val a = A()
    initTag(a, init)
    a.href = href
  }
}

class Body : BodyTag("body")
class UL : BodyTag("ul") {
  fun li(init: LI.() -> Unit) = initTag(LI(), init)
}

class LI : BodyTag("li")
class P : BodyTag("p")

class A : BodyTag("a") {
  var href: String
    get() = attributes["href"] ?: ""
    set(value) {
      attributes["href"] = value
    }
}
```

As you can see, all these classes define a possible hierarchy of calls.
This DSL is just a toy DSL, and therefore it covers a very small and
limited subset of HTML. It is extremely tedious to write the whole HTML
DSL manually. The actual [HTML DSL
implementation](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.html) uses a real [XSD
schema](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.html/blob/master/generate/src/main/resources/html_5.xsd)
to generate all possible classes for the DSL.

### There is always a problem

This could already be awesome, but the example demonstrates a very weird
behaviour — nobody stops you from defining tags inside each other
multiple times.

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **the problem**

</div>

``` kotlin
head {
  head {
    head {
      // stil possible to write head because implicit receiver html is available
    }
  }
  title { +"XML encoding with Kotlin" }
}
```

Prior to Kotlin 1.1, the only solution was to redefine function with
deprecation.

``` kotlin
class Head : Tag("head") {
  @Deprecated(message = "wrong scope", level = DeprecationLevel.ERROR)
  fun head(init: Head.() -> Unit) = initTag(Head(), init)

  fun title(init: Title.() -> Unit) = initTag(Title(), init)
}
```

![](/images/fantastic/err1.png)

The problem with this approach is that it requires an incredible amount
of boilerplate and a full understanding of all possible combinations. In
1.1,
[KEEP-57](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/master/proposals/scope-control-for-implicit-receivers.md)
introduced an alternative to that approach: the `@DslMarker` annotation
was introduced which allows us to define a `DSL marker` and introduces a
set of rules for classes annotated with that marker:

- an implicit receiver may belong to a DSL if marked with a
corresponding DSL marker annotation

- two implicit receivers of the same DSL are not accessible in the same
scope

- the closest one wins

- other available receivers are resolved as usual, but if the resulting
resolved call binds to such a receiver, it’s a compilation error

So, the HTML DSL can be fixed by introducing a `@HtmlTagMarker` DSL
marker and annotating `Tag` with it.

``` kotlin
@HtmlTagMarker
abstract class Tag(val name: String) : Element {
 // ...
}
```

![](/images/fantastic/err2.png)

DSLs that give us an ability to construct nested data structures such as
HTML builders, different configurations, UI builders, etc. is where
Kotlin really shines. Kotlin took an awesome idea from Groovy and made
it safe and easy to use.

There are a few more examples of DSLs of that kind:

- [TeamCity
DSL](http://blog.jetbrains.com/teamcity/2016/11/kotlin-configuration-scripts-an-introduction/)

- [Gradle with Kotlin](http://github.com/gradle/gradle-script-kotlin)

- [Anko](http://github.com/gradle/gradle-script-kotlin)

- [Spek framework](http://spekframework.org)

But unsurprisingly, it’s not the only type of DSL that can be
implemented in Kotlin…

## Fantastic DSL

Not all domains are born the same. Let’s consider a completely different
domain. A system which handles transactions containing a payment in some
currency and two people - a sender and a receiver.

![](/images/fantastic/domain.svg)

The transaction structure has to be immutable to make it safer. But
sometimes, we might need to create a new transaction with an updated
field. For example, the name of the receiver (from) person might need to
be changed to let’s say "John". There are a few ways to implement that
in Kotlin

### Data classes

Let’s start with an idiomatic Kotlin way. The class hierarchy can be
concisely represented as

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **data**

</div>

``` kotlin
data class Transaction(val payment: Payment, val parts: Parts)
data class Payment(val currency: String, val amount: Int)
data class Parts(val from: Person, val to: Person)
data class Person(val id: Int, val name: String)
```

An instance of the `Transaction` can easily be created as well

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **create**

</div>

``` kotlin
val trs = Transaction(
  Payment("AUD", 15),
  Parts(
    Person(0, "Alex"),
    Person(1, "Ben")
  )
)
```

But problems start when we need to update this nested data structure.
Generally, there two ways to do that. The first option is to completely
recreate the transaction which doesn’t look good.

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **update \[1\]**

</div>

``` kotlin
val trans = Transaction(trs.payment, Parts(
  Person(trs.parts.from.id, "John"),
  trs.parts.to)
)
```

Another is to use
[copy](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/data-classes.html#copying)

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **update \[2\]**

</div>

``` kotlin
val stansTrs2 = trs.copy(
  parts = trs.parts.copy(
    from = trs.parts.from.copy(
      name = "John"
    )
  )
)
```

And the copy version doesn’t look good either. Even though it’s
tolerable now, the bigger the data structure, the uglier the code look
like. On a deeply nested immutable data structure, it looks like a
triangle instead of a simple call chain from the mutable world.

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **ohhhh**

</div>

``` kotlin
val stansTrs2 = trs.copy(
  parts = trs.parts.copy(
    from = trs.parts.from.copy(
      person = trs.parts.from.person.copy(
        parts = trs.parts.from.person.parts.copy(
          from = trs.parts.from.person.parts.from.copy(
            person = trs.parts.from.person.parts.from.person.copy(
              parts = trs.parts.from.person.parts.from.person.parts.copy(
                from = trs.parts.from.person.parts.from.person.parts.from.copy(
                  person = trs.parts.from.person.parts.from.person.parts.from.person.copy(
                    parts = trs.parts.from.person.parts.from.person.parts.from.person.parts.copy(
                      from = trs.parts.from.person.parts.from.person.parts.from.person.parts.from.copy(
                        name = "jonh"
                      ))))))))))))
```

Don’t get me wrong, I like parentheses. It feels like a lisp (which I
like a lot), but what no one likes is the wall of boilerplate above.

### Persistent Data Structures

But talking about lisps, there is another awesome language called
Clojure. It’s a lisp running on JVM where every data structure is
persistent (don’t confuse with
[immutable](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10034537/persistent-vs-immutable-data-structure)).
In Clojure, the same problem can be solved by defining the transaction
structure as a persistent map.

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **create**

</div>

``` clojure
(def ts {:payment {:currency "AUD"
                   :amount   15}
         :parts   {:from {:id   0
                          :name "Alex"}
                   :to   {:id   1
                          :name "Ben"}}})
```

Not as concise as Kotlin’s version, but still pretty good. What is
completely different to Kotlin, is the update function

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **update**

</div>

``` clojure
(def ts2 (assoc-in ts [:parts :from :name] "John"))
```

It’s only one line! And it’s exactly what we aimed for. The next picture
might be essential for understanding how it works.

![](/images/fantastic/domain_clj.svg)

Given that each node has a known type - `clojure.lang.APersistentMap` -
and the universal way of traversing is `map.get("key")`, it’s possible
to write a function `assoc-in` which can change a value under a given
"path" and to recreate the data structure [node by
node](http://cjohansen.no/clojure-to-die-for/). But Clojure’s internals
are plain java classes that can be used from Kotlin easily just with a
few "convenience" adapters to keep familiar syntax.

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **create**

</div>

``` kotlin
val tran = pArrayMap(
  "payment" to pArrayMap(
    "currency" to "AUD",
    "amount" to 15
  ),
  "parts" to pArrayMap(
    "from" to pArrayMap(
      "id" to 0,
      "name" to "Alex"
    ),
    "to" to pArrayMap(
      "id" to 1,
      "name" to "Ben"
    )
  )
)
```

Yes, the creation looks rather ugly. It’s untyped, all the key names are
represented as strings, but let’s look at the update function.

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **update**

</div>

``` kotlin
val trans2 = trans.pUpdate(listOf("parts", "from", "name"), "John")
```

It’s still as concise and beautiful as Clojure’s one.

But is it possible to build a DSL which keeps types from Kotlin types
and provides the conciseness of Clojure?

## Cursor DSL

It is possible! Using a special DSL, you can define the structure of the
"transactional" domain in a following way.

``` kotlin
interface Transaction
val <F> Cursor<Transaction, F>.payment by Node<Payment>()
val <F> Cursor<Transaction, F>.parts by Node<Parts>()

interface Payment
val <F> Cursor<Payment, F>.currency by Leaf<String>()
val <F> Cursor<Payment, F>.amount by Leaf<Int>()

interface Parts
val <F> Cursor<Parts, F>.to by Node<Person>()
val <F> Cursor<Parts, F>.from by Node<Person>()

interface Person
val <F> Cursor<Person, F>.id by Leaf<Int>()
val <F> Cursor<Person, F>.name by Leaf<String>()
```

This looks scary, but it’s just a bit of necessary boilerplate. This
code should be read like

<pre style={{margin: 0, background: "white", lineHeight: "125%"}}>
<style>{`
.prh-keyword {
  color: #000080;
  font-weight: bold;
}
.prh-boilerplate {
  opacity: 0.2;
}
`}</style>
<span class="prh-keyword">interface</span> Transaction

The creation looks very similar to the untyped version, but it’s
completely typed. It references properties defined above.

``` kotlin
val trans = domain<Transaction> {
  (payment) {
    currency.set("AUD")
    amount.set(15)
  }
  (parts) {
    (from) {
      id.set(0)
      name.set("Alex")
    }
    (to) {
      id.set(1)
      name.set("Ben")
    }
  }
}
```

It’s possible to update the transaction easily. And not just one field,
in fact, the code above creates an empty data structure and applies an
update function to it.

``` kotlin
val trans2 = trans.cursor.parts.from.update {
  name.set("John")
}
println(trans.cursor.parts.from.name.value) // "Alex"
println(trans2.cursor.parts.from.name.value) // "John"
```

or

``` kotlin
val trans3 = trans2.cursor.update {
  (payment) {
    currency.set("USD")
    amount.set(12)
  }
}
```

What is really awesome is that the `set` function can only be called
inside the `update` block. It’s possible to think about the `update`
block as an open transaction where a few updates are applied.

### Implementation

#### Read

The easiest way to start implementing it is to imagine that the data
structure is already created and everything we need to do is to read a
value from it. The obvious untyped solution will be to call
`trans.get("parts").get("from").get("name")`. And this approach works
fine until we need to update it. After the first `get` call, the
reference to the root transaction is lost and there’ll be no way to run
the update operation.

Instead, it’s possible to focus on the way of traversing the data
structure without loosing the reference to the root. To accomplish this,
it’s possible to implement `Focus` interface which holds the reference
to the root and accumulates a path inside.

``` kotlin
interface Focus<out Op> {
  fun narrow(k: String): Focus<Op>
  val op: Op
}
```

The interesting thing that `Focus` is parametrised over an operation.
That operation can be `Read` or `Write` depending on the context. When a
leaf is reached, the typed version will finally perform an action using
that operation.

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **narrow down the usage**

</div>

``` kotlin
val f = Focus(trans)       // {"root" -> Transaction, path -> []}
val f2 = f.narrow("parts") // {"root" -> Transaction, path -> ["parts"]}
val f3 = f2.narrow("from") // {"root" -> Transaction, path -> ["parts", "from"]}
// ...
```

![](/images/fantastic/domain_focus.svg)

But even though the focus does its job very well, it’s completely
untyped, and strings have to be used to navigate through. The type must
be stored somewhere. As everyone knows that any problem can be solved
with an additional layer of abstraction! Let’s define a wrapper
parametrised over the type of an underlying node.

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **the missed layer**

</div>

``` kotlin
class Cursor<out T, out Op>(val f: Focus<Op>)
```

`Cursor` is parametrised over a node type and the `operation` is derived
from the focus. And now, the `Transaction` definition starts making
sense. The narrowing can be delegated to the `Node` object that knows
the type and uses the name of a property to create a new `Cursor` with a
new `Focus` inside.

``` kotlin
interface Transaction
val <F> Cursor<Transaction, F>.payment by Node<Payment>()
```

Here, the `payment` is an extension property on the `Transaction` type
which is just a marker interface. It will never be instantiated, instead
by delegating property to `Node<Payment>`, the conversion
`Cursor<Transacton, F> => Cursor<Payment, F>` will be made.

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **how Node is defined**

</div>

``` kotlin
open class Node<out T> {
  open operator fun <Op> getValue(ref: Cursor<*, Op>, property: KProperty<*>): Cursor<T, Op> {
    return Cursor(ref.f.narrow(property.name))
  }
}
```

Inside `Node`, a new Cursor is created with the focus narrowing down
using a property name. Using this technique, by just calling extension
properties a focus can narrow down to the last node where the last node
is delegated to `Leaf` instead of `Node`.

``` kotlin
interface Person
val <F> Cursor<Person, F>.name by Leaf<String>()
```

`Leaf<V>` is defined in the same way as Node except for the return value
of `getValue`.

``` kotlin
open class Leaf<out V> {
  open operator fun <Op> getValue(ref: Cursor<*, Op>, property: KProperty<*>): Cursor<Leaf<V>, Op> {
    return Cursor(ref.f.narrow(property.name))
  }
}
```

Leaf is needed to define an extension property that allows reading a
value from that node. The property has the following signature
`val <V, T> Cursor<Leaf<V>, Read<T>>.value: V` which says: given the
cursor focused on a leaf and parametrised over a read operation, provide
a value contained by the leaf.

![](/images/fantastic/domain_red.png)

The remaining logic is described below

``` kotlin
// the main data structure where T type - is the root type
// in our case, T is Transaction.
// root is just an empty persisntent map
class Domain<out T>(val root: PMap = PHashMap.EMPTY)

// The read operation that focus owns (Op)
interface Read<out M> {
  val path: Path         // path to the current node (ex. ["payment", "currency"])
  val domain: Domain<M>  // the reference to the root
}

// the implementation of the focus
class Reader<out T>(val p: Path, val dm: Domain<T>) : Focus<Read<T>> {
  // this is how narrowing happens, just extend the path and keep the refernce to the root
  override fun narrow(k: String): Focus<Read<T>> = Reader(p.append(k), dm)

  override val op: Read<T> = object : Read<T> {
    override val domain: Domain<T> = dm
    override val path: Path = p
  }
}

// take a focus, take a read operation from it and ask for value
// by traversing the root using path
val <V, T> Cursor<Leaf<V>, Read<T>>.value: V
  get() = f.op.path.getIn(f.op.domain.root) as V

// this is how cursor get's created, emtpy path and reference to the root
val <T> Domain<T>.cursor: Cursor<T, Read<T>>
  get() = Cursor(Reader(Path.EMPTY, this))
```

#### Update

So far we can traverse the data structure and read values from it. The
next step is to learn how to update it. Problems start when we realise
that the underlying data structure is persistent and there is no way to
mutate it. To emulate mutation, a special wrapper has to be defined. It
reassigns the reference after each mutation.

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **immutable ⇒ mutable**

</div>

``` kotlin
class Mutable(var m: PMap) {
  fun write(p: Path, a: Any?) {
    m = p.assocIn(m, a)
  }

  fun read(p: Path) = p.getIn(m)
}
```

Then, we’ll need to implement the `Write` operation which supports
reading and writing under a specific path. At first glance, `read`
operation is unnecessary, but it’s needed to read the final result after
all modification were applied using an empty path. Another application
of the `read()` operation is node initialisation. E.g. if you create an
empty domain and decide to write a value to leaf using a cursor, all the
parent nodes need to be initialised first.

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **Op for `Cursor<T, Write>`**

</div>

``` kotlin
interface Write {
  fun read(): Any?
  fun write(a: Any?)
}
```

And the corresponding cursor

``` kotlin
class WriterCursor(val m: Mutable, val path: Path) : Focus<Write> {
  // exactly the same narrowing pattern
  override fun narrow(k: String): Focus<Write> = WriterCursor(m, path.append(k))

  override val op: Write = object : Write {
    override fun write(a: Any?) = m.write(path, a)
    override fun read(): Any? = m.read(path)
  }
}
```

And at some point in time, we might want to switch from the `Read`
cursor to the `Write` cursor. For that, a special function exists.

<div class="formalpara-title">

    **Cursor\<T, Read\> ⇒ Cursor\<T, Write\>**

</div>

``` kotlin
fun <T, M> Cursor<M, Read<T>>.update(update: Cursor<M, Write>.() -> Unit): Domain<T> {
  // take a root, make a mutable from it
  val m = Mutable(f.op.domain.root)
  // create a writer from mutable and apply `update` supplied from outside
  // exactly the same pattern as any other DSL has
  Cursor<M, Write>(WriterCursor(m, f.op.path)).update()
  // read the final value from the root and return a new instance of Domain
  return Domain(m.read(Path.EMPTY) as PMap)
}

// to simplify the initialisation
fun <M> domain(f: Cursor<M, Write>.() -> Unit) = Domain<M>().cursor.update(f)
```

And finally, a set of public typed operation that API consumers use

``` kotlin
// for each leaf initial value is null
// for each node initial value is empty persistent map
fun Write.init(k: KClass<*>) {
  if (read() == null) {
    write(when (k) {
      Leaf::class -> null
      else -> PArrayMap.EMPTY
    })
  }
}

operator inline fun <reified T> Cursor<T, Write>.invoke(
    updateFn: Cursor<T, Write>.() -> Unit): Unit {
  // init the current node (it might be null if we haven't visited it before)
  f.op.init(T::class)
  updateFn()
}

fun <T> Cursor<Leaf<T>, Write>.set(t: T): Unit {
  // just delegate to write
  f.op.write(t)
}
```

The `invoke` function is responsible for Node initialisation whereas
`set` sets the Leaf’s value

``` kotlin
domain<Transaction> {
  (payment) {  // <- here invoke is called
    currency.set("AUD")
    amount.set(15)
  }
}

// ↑ is equal to the desugarised version ↓
domain<Transaction> {
  payment.invoke({
    currency.set("AUD")
    amount.set(15)
  })
}
```

And at the end, a Path that does all the work, but in fact, it does
nothing except for delegating functionality to functions from Clojure
that do all the work on untyped persistent data structures.

``` kotlin
import clojure.`core$assoc_in` as assocIn
import clojure.`core$get_in` as getIn
import clojure.lang.*

data class Path(private val v: APersistentVector) {
  companion object {
    val EMPTY = Path(PersistentVector.EMPTY)
  }

  fun append(a: String): Path = Path(v.cons(a) as APersistentVector)
  fun getIn(model: Any?): Any? = getIn.invokeStatic(model, v)
  fun assocIn(m: Any?, a: Any?): Any? = assocIn.invokeStatic(m, v, a)
}
```

Using these primitives, we built a really powerful type safe DSL to work
on immutable data structures. Yes, it has a few downsides. E.g. data
classes solution has better performance. And most of the time it’s
concise enough, unless you have a really deeply nested tree. In that
case, you might also try to use [the lenses
pattern](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/school/to-infinity-and-beyond/pick-of-the-week/basic-lensing)
which comes from the functional world and solves the same problem. But
if you already have untyped data structures in your project and have to
work with them, Kotlin provides a truly unique set of features that
allows you to build a powerful DSL to make your life safer and easier.

It’s very probable that some parts of the solution shown above might
still be unclear, in that case, I encourage you to clone [the code
example](https://github.com/SerCeMan/talk-fantastic-dsls-example) in
your IDE, run it and try to play with types. It will help a lot and can
give you some interesting ideas on how advanced Kotlin features can be
used.

## Conclusions

- Kotlin provides many unique features to build DSLs easily

- DSLs in Kotlin work best as configuration APIs

- They can be a powerful abstraction over untyped data structures

### Warnings

- Most of the time plain code is better than DSL
There is no point in building DSL "just because I can", plain Kotlin
code is often much easier to read and understand.

- Provide a way to extend and bypass your DSL
If you publish DSL as a part of your API, it’s always a good idea to
give a way to bypass or extend it. Of course, if it’s a Gradle-like
DSL then you can cover everything. But in the case of a html DSL, a
user might want to introduce some tags that your DSL doesn’t support.
Or, he can have an already rendered string which needs to be inserted
somewhere.
